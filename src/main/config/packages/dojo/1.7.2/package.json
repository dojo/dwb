The simpleFetch mixin is not designed to work for datastores that respond to a fetch() call by incrementally loading items, or sequentially loading partial batches of the result set.  For datastores that mixin simpleFetch, simpleFetch implements a fetch method that automatically handles eight of the fetch() arguments -- onBegin, onItem, onComplete, onError, start, count, sort and scope The class mixing in simpleFetch should not implement fetch(), but should instead implement a _fetchItems() method.  The _fetchItems() method takes three arguments, the keywordArgs object that was passed to fetch(), a callback function to be called when the result array is available, and an error callback to be called if something goes wrong. The _fetchItems() method should ignore any keywordArgs parameters for start, count, onBegin, onItem, onComplete, onError, sort, and scope. The _fetchItems() method needs to correctly handle any other keywordArgs parameters, including the query parameter and any optional parameters (such as includeChildren).  The _fetchItems() method should create an array of result items and pass it to the fetchHandler along with the original request object -- or, the _fetchItems() method may, if it wants to, create an new request object with other specifics about the request that are specific to the datastore and pass that as the request object to the handler.

This *StoreLayer* framework is dedicated to provide a uniform way for configuring an existing store, so that it can be easily extended to have special behaviors or act like a totally different store. The major approach is to wrap the *fetch* function of store, layer by layer. Every layer treats the incoming store.fetch as a 'black box', thus maintaining the independence between layers. *fetch* is the most important data retriever in the Read API, almost all other functions are used for a single item, and require that this item is already retrieved (by and only by *fetch*).
